## Programming

</div>

If you want to learn programming, there's a lot of books out there, which may be
a problem if you don't want to waste your precious time looking for good
ones. So here's some recommendations.

### The C Programming Language, 2nd Edition

**Authors:** Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie (Original C designer)

This book is just amazing, it's my first recommendation for everyone who's
trying to learn C. If you are into Computer Science and yet don't know C, I
think you have to learn it as fast as possible. The book has a profound
introduction to the language, every chapter will present a new subject, with
examples and a list of challenging and fun exercises for you that will make you
learn every subject the hard way, things like control flow, functions, program
structure and etc. After you finished the first chapters you will already be
prepared to write useful programs.

In every chapter you'll find an explanation of a new concept and some usage
examples, after you read and understand the given examples, you're going to come
across some exercises â€” and they won't be easy, I promise you, but after finish
it, you will master every detail of the new concept and will suddenly feel
comfortable with the individualities and aspects of C, this is very helpful
because almost all modern programming language is based on C.

I love that the book gives you the feeling of being an developer in the 80's
with nothing but an old computer with a terminal and a C compiler, most of the
time you won't be using any pre-made libraries or functions to solve the
exercises, but will create the solutions from the ground up yourself, which will
be good lesson for you to learn how everything on your computer was made, how it
does simple things like reversing a string, highlighting matching brackets,
searching for files and *et cetera*.

You will see that C is a superb general purpose language to build fast (I mean
**really fast**) programs, having full control of your system and hardware.

You're going to understanding how nowadays modern languages (like Python or Lua)
or operating systems (like GNU/Linux, MacOS, Windows, Android, iOS and etc) only
are easy as it is thanks to brilliant people who have spent hours and hours
writing small pieces of programs to do simple operations for you, so you don't
have to worry about building everything yourself.

#### Where to find it?

You can get a legal copy on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Language-2nd-Brian-Kernighan/dp/0131103628) or try to find it somewhere on the internet
, which isn't difficult since it's the most popular programming book out there.

### Pro Git

**Author:** Scott Chacon

Whether or not you want to be a professional developer, **git** is a tool that
you must know how to use, it's the best version control system out there, and
without it you'll have a painful journey with a lot of headaches trying to keep track of
different versions of your code, reversing break changes, splitting your work
and etc.

Pro Git is a marvelous git book for either beginners or experienced developers,
it covers not only the basics of the tool like creating your first git
repository, recording changes and adding remotes, but also more advanced
concepts like the branching workflow, how Packfiles and Git Objects works, and a
lot more.

#### Where to find it?

You can read it online or download a copy for free on the [git official page](https://git-scm.com) or
buy a "dead tree" version on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Pro-Git-Scott-Chacon/dp/1484200772) as described on git's page.
