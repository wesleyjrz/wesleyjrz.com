Hello, I'm Wesley<sup>1</sup> and this is the first post of my blog, for years
— since I was a kid — I liked to write down my thoughts and share with the
world, that time I enjoyed creating prototypes on Blogger and share content
about Minecraft or computer tricks I had found over the web. The last website I
built was [wesleyjrz.github.io](https://www.wesleyjrz.github.io), which I made while learning HTML, CSS and
JavaScript in my first steps of programming, don't expect that to be a great
website or have advanced stylesheets, most of my JS was taken from Stack
Overflow and I didn't even understand it very well, I just wanted to create
something with my bare hands for the first time, and that's what I did.

Nevertheless, now I want to have a great place to share my thoughts, discoveries
and knowledge, so I built this personal blog using an amazing tool called [Hugo](https://gohugo.io),
it's an incredible fast framework written in [Go](https://go.dev) to create static websites, it
perfect fits my needs, the theme I use is [Notepadium](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-notepadium) which I chose because it
doesn't use any JavaScript, providing a fast, secure and clean experience for
everyone and keeping things as simple as possible. It's possible to access my
website in every Web Browser out there, even those terminal-based ones (except
for the images). I may add some custom JS in the future if it becomes really
necessary, but I don't pretend to.

The name of the website is a joke with the name of C++, which has this name
because it is like C but with a bunch of new features added. This blog is like
my first personal website, but with a lot more added to it, because it isn't
only about me, but it's a repository of knowledge that I acquire being
published, it's like my mind being turned into an open-source project.

*Postea*<sup>2</sup> I'm going to write more about myself in **About** section for those who are
interested, for now you can take a look on this brief overview of my tastes and
projects in my [GitHub Profile](https://www.github.com/wesleyjrz). Also check the source of this website anytime at
[wesleyjrz/wesleyjrz.com](https://www.github.com/wesleyjrz/wesleyjrz.com).

The name of this post is **Aloha World**, because *Aloha* is a Hawaiian greeting
that means either "Hello" or "Goodbye" and it's the word for love as well, and
in programming we always starting learning a new language by writing a code that
prints "Hello world!" on the screen, and I like to write "Aloha world!" as well.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
  puts("Aloha world!");
  return 0;
}
```

That's it, just a short presentation of my new blog for you guys, more coming soon, ***aloha!***
